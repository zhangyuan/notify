## Hello, Notify

This app is initially built for receiving alerts and notifications.

## How to build

* Open the project with Android Studio.
* Copy `app/src/main/assets/app.properties.example` to `app/src/main/assets/app.properties`. Then copy the `app_id` and `app_key` from AVOS Cloud app and paste into it.
